                    <p>Vending became an issue after the pandemic and by March 2, 2022, <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2022/03/mission-plan-cracks-down-on-fires-street-vending-homelessness-and-trash/">Ronen launched a Mission Plan</a> to go after vending, trash, fires and homelessness.</p>
                    <p>"Street conditions in the Mission are unacceptable," the plan states.</p>
                    <p>The first plan envisioned permitting vendors so that staffers from the Department of Public works and officers could discern between permitted vendors and those without a permit who were also likely selling stolen merchandise.</p>
                    <p>This photo was taken on April 25, 2022 — less than two months after Ronen launched the plan.</p>

                    <p>The permits are clearly not working. Permitted vendors are sometimes out, but the plazas continue to be overrun by vendors selling goods — likely stolen — out of their backpacks and suitcases.</p>
                    <p>At a community meeting, the 116 permitted vendors and others are clearly frustrated with the lack of enforcement.</p>
                    <p>“There’s no hierarchy, we’re all out there to do business and survive,” said Ryen Motzek, president of the Mission Merchants Association.</p>
                    <p>Susana Rojas, executive director of Calle 24, spoke in support of the permitted vendors. “Those of us from the Mission know we’ve had vendors all along.”</p>
