            <div class="intro-graf">Julie Kirschbaum, the acting director of the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, has landed the gig full-time after being appointed head of the agency today by Mayor Daniel Lurie.</div>

In August 2004, then-Mayor Newsom appointed Elsbernd to a vacancy on the Board of Supervisors. Elsbernd was later elected and re-elected as District 7 Supervisor for two terms from 2004 to 2012. After Elsbernd termed out in 2012, the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein appointed him to be her state director. He remained in that job until Breed picked him to helm her ship. <a href="#top">Back ↑</a>

                Zou has been the campaign manager for Lurie's mayoral campaign since May 2024. Previously, Zou was known in the political scene as the door-knocking genius who helped Assemblymember Matt Haney sway Asian voters in his <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2022/04/election-2022-what-to-watch-for-in-haney-campos-assembly-race/">winning assembly race</a> in 2022 and, before that, his <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2018/11/election-2018-how-matt-haney-surprised-everyone-even-himself/">District 6 supervisor race</a> in 2018. In this election, Zou, along with Kit Lam, the campaign's Chinese community-outreach lead and a school board recall activist, helped create a landslide victory among Asian voters. As Mission Local's Yujie Zhou reported, <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2024/11/daniel-lurie-won-asian-votes-but-how/">almost every heavily Asian precinct marked Lurie as their first choice</a>, including neighborhoods such as the Sunset, the Richmond, the Excelsior, Portola, Visitacion Valley, and Chinatown. <a href="#top">Back ↑</a>

                Yep is a former SFPD commander and current member of Lurie's transition team. As the Chief of Public Safety in the mayor's office, Yep will coordinate a multitude of criminal justice services aimed at community and neighborhood safety. Yep will be in charge of coordinating multiple departments: Adult Probation, Police Accountability, Department of Emergency Management, the Fire Department, Sheriff Inspector General, Juvenile Probation, Police Department, Victim and Witness Rights.</br>
                </br>
                Yep retired from the SFPD in 2023 after 28 years, serving in district stations across the city and as a commanding officer. As an SFPD commander, Yep would sometimes take the lead at town halls that followed a police shooting. An alumnus of Lowell High School and San Francisco State University, Yep was born and raised in San Francisco.</br>
                </br>
                Yep was an early Lurie supporter and a key bridge into the Chinese community — one vital to Lurie's election. He is well-known in that community and his appointment is likely to reassure that community that Lurie takes their concerns seriously. <a href="#top">Back ↑</a>

                John-Baptiste is currently the <a href="https://www.spur.org/about/staff/alicia-john-baptiste">president and chief executive officer</a> of the San Francisco Bay Area Planning and Urban Research Association (SPUR). John-Baptiste has been leading urban policy nonprofit for about six years and deputy director for three years. Prior to her time at SPUR, John-Baptiste worked for about 16 years at City Hall between the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency and the Planning Department.</br>
                </br>
                SPUR's recent <a href="https://www.spur.org/publications/spur-report/2024-07-31/designed-serve">report</a> on better governance is one that <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2024/12/sf-mayor-daniel-lurie-changing-mayors-office-deputy-mayors-policy-chiefs/">several political groups have pointed to</a> as a road map for amending the city's charter. It recommends eliminating rules restricting “mayoral staffing and management” by striking portions of the city charter instituted by Prop. H back in 1991. It also suggests restructuring the mayor's office to allow for “a more manageable number of direct reports.” John-Baptiste said in the press release that she is "excited to directly implement a recommendation from SPUR's good government work by joining the newly-created team of policy chiefs.”</br>
                </br>
                In this new position, John-Baptiste will help Lurie coordinate with the Environment Department, the MTA, the Port of San Francisco, the Public Utilities Commission, the Department of Public Works, and the Recreation and Parks Department. <a href="#top">Back ↑</a>
