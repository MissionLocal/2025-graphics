            <div class="intro-graf">They come from a variety of backgrounds: Six are City Hall officials, including Mandelman and Lurie's policy chief, Alicia John-Baptiste; four are from political pressure groups that have spent heavily to lobby and campaign for different political figures; and four come from philanthropy, including one from the personal foundation of venture capitalist billionaire <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2024/10/michael-moritz-san-francisco-togethersf-sf-elections-crankstart/">Michael Moritz</a>.</div>
            <div class="intro-graf">Six are from the business and development sector, two are from urban think tanks, and five herald from universities and community nonprofits. Just one is from organized labor.</div>

It was, however, heavily financed by Moritz.</div>

                <b>Alicia John-Baptiste</b>, who is <b>Lurie's policy chief</b> on infrastructure, climate and mobility, is representing the mayor's office in the group. Charter reform is now one of Lurie's key priorities, according to the mayor's office, and John-Baptiste is well-positioned to take the reins: She is the former CEO of SPUR, an urban think tank that recently published a report listing out <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2025/11/spur-sf-charter-reform/">10 charter reform recommendations</a> like increasing the power of the City Administrator and raising the threshold for issues to end up on the ballot for voters.<br></br>
                Senior city officials are also part of leading the conversation, including <b>City Administrator Carmen Chu</b>, who oversees more than 25 departments and an annual budget of over $750 million. One of the key recommendations from SPUR is to enhance the power of Chu's position and department. <b>City Controller Greg Wagner</b>, who acts as the city's auditor and chief financial officer, is also involved.
